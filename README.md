# Battle

Each Transformer has the following criteria on their tech spec from 1 to 10 :- 
● Strength
● Intelligence
● Speed
● Endurance
● Rank
● Courage
● Firepower
● Skill

The “overall rating” of a Transformer is the following formula:
(Strength + Intelligence + Speed + Endurance + Firepower)
# Note:-
# Input the Autobots names and Decepticons name to play the game.
# If input name is Optimus Prime or Predaking Special rules apply

# The basic rules of the battle are:
● The teams should be sorted by rank and faced off one on one against each other in order to
determine a victor, the loser is eliminated
● A battle between opponents uses the following rules:
    ○ If any fighter is down 4 or more points of courage and 3 or more points of strength
    compared to their opponent, the opponent automatically wins the face-off regardless of
    overall rating (opponent has ran away)
    ○ Otherwise, if one of the fighters is 3 or more points of skill above their opponent, they win
    the fight regardless of overall rating
    ○ The winner is the Transformer with the highest overall rating
● In the event of a tie, both Transformers are considered destroyed
● Any Transformers who don’t have a fight are skipped (i.e. if it’s a team of 2 vs. a team of 1, there’s
only going to be one battle)
● The team who eliminated the largest number of the opposing team is the winner


# Special rules:
● Any Transformer named Optimus Prime or Predaking wins his fight automatically regardless of
any other criteria
● In the event either of the above face each other (or a duplicate of each other), the game
immediately ends with all competitors destroyed
